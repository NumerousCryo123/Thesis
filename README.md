üß™ Thesis: Modeling Heterodyning Effects in Neurons using NEURON Simulator

This code demonstrates how to construct a myelinated neuron model in NEURON that is stimulated by alternating current (AC) sources through both extracellular and intracellular media. ‚ö° Heterodyning is a process where two signals of different frequencies are fed into a non-linear electrical component, producing new frequencies ‚Äî specifically, the sum and difference of the original frequencies. If the input frequencies are f1 and f2, the resulting frequencies are: sum frequency = f1 + f2, difference frequency = |f1 - f2|. This principle is fundamental in telecommunications, allowing frequency translation and communication using smaller antennas. ‚öôÔ∏è A mixer is a non-linear circuit component that combines two input signals, with a voltage-dependent current‚Äìvoltage (I‚ÄìV) relationship. A common implementation is the Gilbert Cell Mixer: üîó https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228977791_A_Gilbert_cell_mixer_with_a-digitally-controlled_performance_space.

Interestingly, the axon hillock in neurons is also non-linear, and its ionic current can be expressed inline as It = g_Na_init * m^3 * h * (V - E_Na) + g_K_init * n^4 * (V - E_K) + g_L_init * (V - E_L), where g_Na_init, g_K_init, g_L_init are maximal conductances, m, h, n are gating variables, V is the membrane potential, and E_Na, E_K, E_L are reversal potentials. This suggests that applying two different electrical signals to a neuron could produce heterodyned frequencies.

The NEURON model simulates a myelinated axon, applies two AC signals (intracellular + extracellular), and observes whether heterodyned frequency components appear in the membrane potential. üß¨ Neuron Heterodyning Model Diagram: ![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/139307e5-e0e9-41fb-8343-7644806e2f3d) | Electronic Circuit Representation of Neuron: ![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26c28683-59fb-49e2-8f4b-3da9f7938f92).

The neuron can be represented as an electro-chemical integrate-and-fire cell, analogous to an RC electronic circuit, where resistance and capacitance naturally emerge. üóÇ Work done in the files: axonB10.hoc constructs a myelinated CNS neuron stimulated exogenously and endogenously; axonB5.hoc stimulates the neuron endogenously; axonA.hoc stimulates the neuron with two exogenous waves; mosinit.hoc launches a GUI to visualize results. üèÉ How to run the code: open NEURON and load the desired .hoc file (e.g., mosinit.hoc), use the GUI to start simulations and visualize membrane potentials, for dual-signal heterodyning experiments run axonA.hoc, and optionally export data for FFT analysis to observe heterodyned frequencies. This workflow bridges neuroscience and communication theory, showing how non-linear biological components can mimic engineered signal mixers.
